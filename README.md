# Compiler-integrated Annotation Collector

Trying out designs for SMPL's static analysis tool which needs type info (and I prefer not to duplicate work).

The [reflect](https://github.com/8BitMate/reflect) library might also work.

Tested on Rust version: rustc 1.49.0-nightly (5404efc28 2020-11-11).
